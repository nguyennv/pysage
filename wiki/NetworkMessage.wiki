#summary Network Message

==Network Messages==
Network messages can automatically pack and unpack themselves for purposes of being transported via UDP across the network.  "types" class variable needs to be defined for each message that is intended for network use.
{{{
class SmallMessage(Message):
    properties = ['content']
    types = ['p']
    packet_type = 103

mgr.queue_message(SmallMessage(content="hello world"))

class LargeMessage(Message):
    properties = ['account_numbers']
    types = ['ai']
    packet_type = 104

mgr.queue_message(LargeMessage(account_numbers=[100,101,102,109]))

}}}

besides all the format types supported by python's "struct" module, additional ones are supported by pysage:
|| *Type* || *Description* ||
||"an"||array of arbitrary length of type "n"||
||"S"||a long string of arbitrary size, bigger than 255||
