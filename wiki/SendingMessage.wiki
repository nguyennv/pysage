#summary outlines pysage API for sending messages

Messages can be sent through three different kinds of channels:
  # local: messages can be delivered to actors in the local process.  No serialization or deserialization is done on the message.  The message is delivered as is, a python object.
  # IPC: messages can be delivered to another pysage group.  Messages will be serialized and deserailized and sent over a platform specific channel (domain socket or a named pipe).
  # Network: messages will be serialized and deserialized.  The delivery depends on the network transport protocol choosen by the user.  (so far raknet is offered, raw TCP/UDP coming).

ActorManager class offers the following types of methods:

|| *Function* || *Local* || *IPC* || *Network* || *description* ||
||`trigger`||y||_||_||used to immediately process a message synchronously.  

Trigger delivers the message to all subscribers of that message type and returns after the message is processed||
||`queue_message`||y||_||_||puts the message on a queue.  Message will be processed next time "tick" is called||
||`queue_message_to_group`||_||y||_||immediately delivers the message to another pysage group via IPC.  It is up to the called group to process the message||
||`send_message`||_||_||y||immediately delivers the message to another pysage compatible node.  It's up to the called node to process the message||
